# Ice Age Styled Tamagotchi

A Ruby app that emulates an Ice Age stylization of Tamagotchi toy - saber-toothed squirrel **Scrat**

## Setup Assuming you have ruby installed, in the terminal:

Your options to interact with your Ice Age Tamagotchi are:

.give_food()

.give_water()

.put_to_cave()

.give_cure()

.give_acorn()

You can also check how your Tamagotchi is doing with:

.life()

.mood()

.satiety()

.thirst()

.health() 

.big_acorn()

.irritability()

.weariness() 

Some of this Ice Age Tamagotchi's levels get to zero, your Tamagotchi will lose 1 life or will die. Or you (ha-ha-ha)

## Motivation

To practice creating a complex time-sensitive ruby class with numerous interacting methods.
